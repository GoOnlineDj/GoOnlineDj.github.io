        Understanding 755 Permissions:
        The 755 permission setting is broken down as follows:

        <!-- Owner (User): Read, write, and execute permissions (7).
Group: Read and execute permissions (5).
Others: Read and execute permissions (5).
Detailed Breakdown:
Owner (User): 7 (Read r, Write w, Execute x)
The owner of the directory can read, write, and execute (access) the directory.
Group: 5 (Read r, Execute x)
Members of the group can read and execute (access) the directory, but cannot write to it.
Others: 5 (Read r, Execute x)
All other users can read and execute (access) the directory, but cannot write to it. -->
